The goal of the research is to identify climate patterns since 1990. The research accounts for different locations, in each hemisphere around Earth. The objective is to understand the different variables that cause global issues.

We use statistical approach to identify and understand global phenomenon and refer latest researches to facilitate our findings and validate sources to make sure what is reported is to be held to the highest standards and should be true. Knowledge requires perseverance and integrity.

Raising awareness among communities and individuals so they can take action to address the immediate climate threats created by wildfires, floods, droughts and other extreme events, with a focus on the most vulnerable populations and prepare to the impacts of climate change and environmental public health threats.
